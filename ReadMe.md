Hi, My name is Joseph Valancy, and this is my Github Portfolio.

## About Me

My Master’s degree is in digital media and visual language, in which I specialized in techniques of visual and interactive media, as well as innovative ways to harness mobile technology in ways of reaching new audiences. In 2016 I completed a semester with Florida International University/Miami Ad Institute's digital marketing master's degree program. I then entered the master's degree program in digital media and visual language in the University of Central Florida because I believed it was a more intensive, comprehensive program.


While working on my masters degree, I created a digital asset management system that allows for companies to better capitalize on internet trends for their social media feeds. I also interned for an online learning platform in which I was responsible for overhauling the user interface to help encourage users to regularly return to the platform. 


In 2019, I applied an augmented reality phone application in the Orlando Museum of Art to make exhibits more immersive for visitors. 


I recently finished a contract with Colorado State University’s Cooperative Institute for Research into the Atmosphere, where I worked with NOAA at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to develop a program that renders hurricane data in a three dimensional space in a way that can be easily viewed and understood by meteorologists on a strict deadline, and deliver visual models that are fast, accurate and up to date. This involved me beta testing new open source software utilized for the creation of storm models.


I am now seeking to enter the private commercial market to expand my work experience and application of my technical skills.
