The Readme to my portfolio
I took the reset sheet from the public domain one shown in class. I left the credit in the sheet.
I had a the casing wrong on one thing, and I was baning my head against the wall before I realized what was wrong.
Still not sure about the button highlights, I could improve them more.
Going to play with the absolute positioning of my picture and about me sign more. Watch this get graded the moment I upload another wip version I don't like.
